The CSLU Toolkit as described in TalkingAvatarReadme.
	run cslu206
	--select all c source code options and any languages you would like to use
	-use the "bsync.tcl" in the LSSRobotWin32 repository and copy and paste it over C:\Program Files\CSLU\Toolkit\2.0\script\bsync_1.0\bsync.tcl
	-run the "baldi sync" application to get the face window and the TTS window
		-if no short cut is found go to C:\Program Files\CSLU\Toolkit\2.0\apps and set the baldiSync.tcl file's
			default program to wish80.exe (C:\Program Files\CSLU\Tcl80\bin)
		-should be able to double click baldiSync.tcl to run
	-right click on the face and go to preferences
		-change face to desired face (Lily)
		-change emotions as needed (ie .1 happy) -> keep neutral at max to avoid highly distorted faces
		-click save when satisfied
	-click into the TTS window where text would be entered in to make it possible for the code to simulate keystrokes into there
	NOTE: BaldiSync needs a microphone and speaker attached to run.  If it has an error opening and the desired devices are set to default,
		disable any other undesired devices, then try to open the program again.

Microsoft Speech SDK 11:

If there are errors dealing with "clr" module, unzip Python for .NET into the working directory along with a copy of the python.exe from the Python27 folder after installing python 2.7
If you're using Windows 8 and you have these issues, install Python for .NET usind PIP (after installing pip, run "pip install pythonnet". Then, remove all the files in "pthon for .net.zip" from lssrobotwin32).
